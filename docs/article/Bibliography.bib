  abstract={We propose and implement a quasi-discrete Hankel transform algorithm based on Dini series expansion (DQDHT) in this paper. By making use of the property that the zero-order Bessel function derivative J ' 0 (0) = 0, the DQDHT can be used to calculate the values on the symmetry axis directly. In addition, except for the truncated treatment of the input function, no other approximation is made, thus the DQDHT satisfies the discrete Parseval theorem for energy conservation, implying that it has a high numerical accuracy. Further, we have performed several numerical tests. The test results show that the DQDHT has a very high numerical accuracy and keeps energy conservation even after thousands of times of repeating the transform either in a spatial domain or in a frequency domain. Finally, as an example, we have applied the DQDHT to the nonlinear propagation of a Gaussian beam through a Kerr medium system with cylindrical symmetry. The calculated results are found to be in excellent agreement with those based on the conventional 2D-FFT algorithm, while the simulation based on the proposed DQDHT takes much less computing time.}

abstract = "Abstract The numerical instability observed in electromagnetic particle-in-cell (EM-PIC) simulations with a plasma drifting with relativistic velocities is studied using both theory and computer simulations. We derive the numerical dispersion relation for a cold plasma drifting with a relativistic velocity, and find an instability attributed to the intersection between beam resonances and the electromagnetic modes in the drifting plasma. The intersection can occur in the fundamental Brillouin zones when \{EM\} waves with phase velocities less than the speed of light exist, and from aliasing beam resonances and aliasing \{EM\} modes. The unstable modes are neither purely transverse nor longitudinal. The characteristic patterns of the instability in Fourier space for various simulation setups and Maxwell equation solvers are explored by solving the corresponding numerical dispersion relations. Furthermore, based upon these characteristic patterns, we derive an asymptotic expression for the instability growth rate. The asymptotic expression greatly speeds up the calculation of the instability growth rate and makes the parameter scans for minimal growth rate feasible even for full three dimensions. The results are compared against simulation results, and good agreements are found. These results can be used as a guide to develop possible approaches to mitigate the instability. We examine the use of a spectral solver and show that such a solver when combined with a low pass filter with a cutoff value of | k → | essentially eliminates the instability while not modifying modes of physical interest. The use of a spectral solver also provides minimal errors to electromagnetic modes in the lowest Brillouin zones. "

The algorithm integrates the unaveraged coupled equations for the particles and the electromagnetic fields in a discrete spectral domain. Using this algorithm, it is possible to perform full three-dimensional or axisymmetric simulations of short-wavelength amplification.

abstract = "Abstract When using an electromagnetic particle-in-cell (EM-PIC) code to simulate a relativistically drifting plasma, a violent numerical instability known as the numerical Cerenkov instability (NCI) occurs. The \{NCI\} is due to the unphysical coupling of electromagnetic waves on a grid to wave–particle resonances, including aliased resonances, i.e., ω + 2 π μ / Δ t = ( k 1 + 2 π ν 1 / Δ x 1 ) v 0 , where μ and ν 1 refer to the time and space aliases and the plasma is drifting relativistically at velocity v 0 in the 1 ˆ -direction. We extend our previous work Xu et al. (2013) by recasting the numerical dispersion relation of a relativistically drifting plasma into a form which shows explicitly how the instability results from the coupling modes which are purely transverse electromagnetic (EM) modes and purely longitudinal modes in the rest frame of the plasma for each time and space aliasing. The dispersion relation for each μ and ν 1 is the product of the dispersion relation of these two modes set equal to a coupling term that vanishes in the continuous limit. The new form of the numerical dispersion relation provides an accurate method of systematically calculating the growth rate and location of the mode in the fundamental Brillouin zone for any Maxwell solver for each μ and ν 1 . We then focus on the spectral Maxwell solver and systematically discuss its \{NCI\} modes. We show that the second fastest growing \{NCI\} mode for the spectral solver corresponds to μ = ν 1 = 0 , that it has a growth rate approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the fastest growing μ = 0 and ν 1 = 1 mode, and that its location in the k space fundamental Brillouin zone is sensitive to the grid size and time step. Based on these studies, strategies to systematically eliminate the \{NCI\} modes for a spectral solver are developed. We apply these strategies to both relativistic collisionless shock and \{LWFA\} simulations, and demonstrate that high-fidelity multi-dimensional simulations of drifting plasmas can be carried out with a spectral Maxwell solver with no evidence of numerical Cerenkov instability.

abstract = "Abstract Simulating laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) in a Lorentz boosted frame in which the plasma drifts towards the laser with v b can speed up the simulation by factors of γ b 2 = ( 1 − v b 2 / c 2 ) − 1 . In these simulations the relativistic drifting plasma inevitably induces a high frequency numerical instability that contaminates the interesting physics. Various approaches have been proposed to mitigate this instability. One approach is to solve Maxwell equations in Fourier space (a spectral solver) as this has been shown to suppress the fastest growing modes of this instability in simple test problems using a simple low pass or “ring” or “shell” like filters in Fourier space. We describe the development of a fully parallelized, multi-dimensional, particle-in-cell code that uses a spectral solver to solve Maxwell's equations and that includes the ability to launch a laser using a moving antenna. This new EM-PIC code is called UPIC-EMMA and it is based on the components of the \{UCLA\} \{PIC\} framework (UPIC). We show that by using UPIC-EMMA, \{LWFA\} simulations in the boosted frames with arbitrary γ b can be conducted without the presence of the numerical instability. We also compare the results of a few \{LWFA\} cases for several values of γ b , including lab frame simulations using OSIRIS, an EM-PIC code with a finite-difference time domain (FDTD) Maxwell solver. These comparisons include cases in both linear and nonlinear regimes. We also investigate some issues associated with numerical dispersion in lab and boosted frame simulations and between \{FDTD\} and spectral solvers. "

In particular, Haber et al. presented in 1973 a pseudo-spectral solver that integrates analytically the solution over a finite time step, under the usual assumption that the source is constant over that time step. Yet, pseudo-spectral solvers have not been widely used, due in part to the difficulty for efficient parallelization owing to global communications associated with global \{FFTs\} on the entire computational domains. A method for the parallelization of electromagnetic pseudo-spectral solvers is proposed and tested on single electromagnetic pulses, and on Particle-In-Cell simulations of the wakefield formation in a laser plasma accelerator. The method takes advantage of the properties of the Discrete Fourier Transform, the linearity of Maxwell’s equations and the finite speed of light for limiting the communications of data within guard regions between neighboring computational domains. Although this requires a small approximation, test results show that no significant error is made on the test cases that have been presented. The proposed method opens the way to solvers combining the favorable parallel scaling of standard finite-difference methods with the accuracy advantages of pseudo-spectral methods. "

We present a new family of algorithms, principally for Abel inversion, that are recursive and hence computationally efficient. The methods are based on a linear, space-variant, state-variable model of the Abel transform. The model is the basis for deterministic algorithms, applicable when data are noise free, and least-squares-estimation (Kalman filter) algorithms, which accommodate the noisy data case. Both one-pass (filtering) and two-pass (smoothing) estimators are considered. In computer simulations, the new algorithms compare favorably with previous methods for Abel inversion.},

It is, however, not free of the usual numerical instabilities, including the numerical Cherenkov instability, when applied to relativistic beam simulations. This paper derives and solves the numerical dispersion relation for the \{PSATD\} algorithm and compares the results with corresponding behavior of the more conventional pseudo-spectral time-domain (PSTD) and finite difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithms. In general, \{PSATD\} offers superior stability properties over a reasonable range of time steps. More importantly, one version of the \{PSATD\} algorithm, when combined with digital filtering, is almost completely free of the numerical Cherenkov instability for time steps (scaled to the speed of light) comparable to or smaller than the axial cell size.

The presented formula for the current density associated with the motion of a single quasi-particle is the unique linear combination of form-factor differences in consistency with the discrete continuity equation.

abstract = "Modeling of laser-plasma wakefield accelerators in an optimal frame of reference [1] has been shown to produce orders of magnitude speed-up of calculations from first principles. Obtaining these speedups required mitigation of a high-frequency instability that otherwise limits effectiveness. In this paper, methods are presented which mitigated the observed instability, including an electromagnetic solver with tunable coefficients, its extension to accommodate Perfectly Matched Layers and Friedman’s damping algorithms, as well as an efficient large bandwidth digital filter. It is observed that choosing the frame of the wake as the frame of reference allows for higher levels of filtering or damping than is possible in other frames for the same accuracy. Detailed testing also revealed the existence of a singular time step at which the instability level is minimized, independently of numerical dispersion. A combination of the techniques presented in this paper prove to be very efficient at controlling the instability, allowing for efficient direct modeling of 10&#xa0;GeV class laser plasma accelerator stages. The methods developed in this paper may have broader application, to other Lorentz-boosted simulations and Particle-In-Cell simulations in general. "

abstract = "Abstract Rapidly growing numerical instabilities routinely occur in multidimensional particle-in-cell computer simulations of plasma-based particle accelerators, astrophysical phenomena, and relativistic charged particle beams. Reducing instability growth to acceptable levels has necessitated higher resolution grids, high-order field solvers, current filtering, etc. except for certain ratios of the time step to the axial cell size, for which numerical growth rates and saturation levels are reduced substantially. This paper derives and solves the cold beam dispersion relation for numerical instabilities in multidimensional, relativistic, electromagnetic particle-in-cell programs employing either the standard or the Cole–Karkkainnen finite difference field solver on a staggered mesh and the common Esirkepov current-gathering algorithm. Good overall agreement is achieved with previously reported results of the \{WARP\} code. In particular, the existence of select time steps for which instabilities are minimized is explained. Additionally, an alternative field interpolation algorithm is proposed for which instabilities are almost completely eliminated for a particular time step in ultra-relativistic simulations. "

When simulating relativistic beams and streaming plasmas in multiple dimensions, they are, however, subject to the numerical Cherenkov instability. Previous studies have shown that instability growth rates can be reduced substantially by modifying slightly the transverse fields as seen by the streaming particles. Here, we offer an approach which completely eliminates the fundamental mode of the numerical Cherenkov instability while minimizing the transverse field corrections. The procedure, numerically computed residual growth rates (from weaker, higher order instability aliases), and comparisons with simulations using the code Warp are presented. In some instances, there are no numerical instabilities whatsoever, at least in the linear regime. "
