This paper reviews a number of algorithms that have only recently been exposed in the literature. Results of a comparative study of some useful algorithms are presented. It is found that the performance of all algorithms depends on the type of function to be transformed. The projection based methods provide acceptable accuracy with better efficiency than numerical quadrature. "

abstract = {The Abel transform and its inverse appear in a wide variety of problems in which it is necessary to reconstruct axisymetric functions from line-integral projections. We present a new family of algorithms, principally for Abel inversion, that are recursive and hence computationally efficient. The methods are based on a linear, space-variant, state-variable model of the Abel transform. The model is the basis for deterministic algorithms, applicable when data are noise free, and least-squares-estimation (Kalman filter) algorithms, which accommodate the noisy data case. Both one-pass (filtering) and two-pass (smoothing) estimators are considered. In computer simulations, the new algorithms compare favorably with previous methods for Abel inversion.},

abstract = {We outline here a new algorithm for evaluating Hankel (Fourier--Bessel) transforms numerically with enhanced speed, accuracy, and efficiency. A nonlinear change of variables is used to convert the one-sided Hankel transform integral into a two-sided cross-correlation integral. This correlation integral is then evaluated on a discrete sampled basis using fast Fourier transforms. The new algorithm offers advantages in speed and substantial advantages in storage requirements over conventional methods for evaluating Hankel transforms with large numbers of points.},

Since the method preserves the discrete form of the Parseval theorem, it is particularly suitable for field propagation. A general algorithm for propagating an input field through axially symmetric systems using the generalized method is given. The advantages and the disadvantages of the method with respect to other typical methods are discussed.},
